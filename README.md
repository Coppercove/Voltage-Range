# Voltage-Range
C Program to categorize input into correct Voltage range.
Write a C Language Program that will prompt for and read in a voltage value (in volts).  Your program will then determine if the proper representation (i.e., a value between 1.00 and 999.99) of the voltage would be Gigavolts, Megavolts, kilovolts, volts, millivolts, microvolts, or nanovolts.  Include the appropriate abbreviation for the units with your numeric answer.
